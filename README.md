## 👋 Hi, I'm Bre!

I'm a self-taught developer on a serious journey to build real skills from the ground up.  
Currently focused on mastering **Python**, from the basics to OOP, while slowly building my portfolio with hands-on projects.

### 📚 Learning Journey

🧠 **Learning Philosophy:**
- **Growth Mindset** – Inspired by the book *Mindset* by Carol Dweck  
- **Observe → Imitate → Modify** – Learn by doing and understanding core concepts  
- **Slow but strong** – I prefer deep, steady learning over rushing through

💻 **Main Focus:**
- Python: basics, functions, up to OOP
- Programming logic & debugging
- Data structures & basic algorithms
- Tools: Git, Linux terminal, VS Code
- Learning platforms: FreeCodeCamp, Kelas Terbuka, YouTube, Coddy Tech

### 🔧 Active Projects

- **PyNoobToPro** 📘  
  My personal Python learning repository: notes, exercises, and mini-projects from scratch to OOP.

- **Mini App Practice** 🛠️  
  Small programs to strengthen core logic, like CLI calculators, to-do lists, and more.

### 🎯 Personal Goals

- Build a portfolio with real-world, working code  
- Level up financially through tech skills  
- Work remotely and live in Bali again 🌴  
- Maintain a healthy balance between work and healing to avoid burnout

### 🧰 Tech Stack

- Languages: `Python`
- Tools: `Git`, `VS Code`, `Linux CLI`
- Learning next: `DevOps fundamentals`, `clean code`, and `best programming practices`
